# 🚀 SkillSwap – Learn by Teaching  

## 📌 Overview  
**SkillSwap** is a peer-to-peer online platform where people can **exchange skills** with each other.  
Instead of paying money, users “trade” knowledge — for example:  
- I know Python but want to learn Java.  
- You know Java but want to learn Python.  
👉 SkillSwap connects us so we can teach and learn from each other.  

This creates a **barter-style learning community**, making education more accessible, collaborative, and fun.

## ✨ Features (MVP)  
- 🔎 Smart Skill Matching (find people who want your skill)  
- ⏳ Credit System (earn credits by teaching, spend to learn)  
- 🎥 Interactive Learning (chat, video calls, screen sharing)  
- ✅ Trust & Verification (badges, ratings, skill tests)  
- 🎮 Gamification (leaderboards, skill trees, achievements)  
- 🤝 Community Projects (collaborate & practice skills)

## 🛣️ Roadmap  

### ✅ Phase 1 – Idea & Planning  
- Define core MVP features (profiles, matching, chat, credits)  
- Choose Tech Stack (React, Node.js, PostgreSQL/MongoDB)  
- Set up GitHub repo & project structure  

### 🏗️ Phase 2 – Project Setup  
- Initialize frontend (React + Tailwind)  
- Initialize backend (Express.js / Spring Boot)  
- Setup database (PostgreSQL/MongoDB)  
- Setup authentication (JWT/OAuth)  
- Configure `.env` for secrets  

### 🧑‍💻 Phase 3 – Core Development (MVP)  
- User system (register, login, profile with skills)  
- Matching algorithm (direct skill swap)  
- Chat system (Socket.io)  
- Credit system (earn by teaching, spend by learning)  
- Review system (ratings after sessions)  

### 🎨 Phase 4 – UI/UX Improvements  
- Build dashboard for learners & teachers  
- Skill tags & search filters  
- Notifications for matches  
- Gamification (badges, leaderboards)  

### 🚀 Phase 5 – Advanced Features  
- AI-powered skill matching  
- Skill verification tests  
- Group learning rooms (1 teacher → many learners)  
- Project collaboration boards  
- Mobile app (React Native / Flutter)  

### ☁️ Phase 6 – Deployment  
- Setup CI/CD (GitHub Actions)  
- Deploy backend (AWS / Render / Railway)  
- Deploy frontend (Vercel / Netlify)  
- Host database (AWS RDS / MongoDB Atlas)  
- Domain + SSL setup  

### 📈 Phase 7 – Scaling & Monetization  
- Premium features (priority matching, expert mentors)  
- Corporate version (internal skill-sharing)  
- Sponsorships & partnerships (edtech, coding bootcamps)
